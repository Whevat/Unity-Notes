Class - Determines whether the Variable is public or private, the difference being that a public Variable can be accessed from Unity and becomes a slot, while a private Variable can only be used in the script it is housed in
Use Amount - The amount of times the Variable is referenced (used)
Type - Determines what the value can be there is five types; String (text must have ""), Int[erger] (Whole numbers), Float (Numbers with a decimal value up to 6 places), Double (Numbers with a decimal value up to 15 places, & Bool (True or False).
Reference Name - The name that the Variable is called by in the code
Value - The amount/text/bool that the Variable contains

These are used everywhere, [[Functions]], If statements (see them here >[[Tags, Layers, & If Statements]]), [[Changing Colours of a Sprite]], etc. They can also bet setup with the public class to make them able to changed in #UI.
