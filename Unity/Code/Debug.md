Debug is a class, filled with a bunch of little things, that can help a lot with development.

There are many sub classes of Debug, but I'll talk about the ones I've used;

.Log - Any text, [[Variables]], or [[Functions]] will be output into the console.

.DrawRay - Makes a 3D line, in the world, attached to the object locally.
