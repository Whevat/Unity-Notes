Many games have different scenes, or areas. This makes the game easier to load as it is in little chunks.
This effect is achieved in two main parts, the code & the settings. Lets start with the settings;

*These annotations can help guide you, just make sure to read them in order. You can also use the hotkey mentioned in [[Scene UI Hotkeys]] or [[Building & Running Games]] talks about this too*

Once this is said & done, you can move onto the coding part of the scene management;

SceneManager.LoadScene(#);

*You can also use [[Variables]] to control where you go, but all in one thing.*

*Sorry about the white*

You will also need to add *SceneManagement* to the file that you use this code in.
