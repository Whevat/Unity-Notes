A Object can be given a tag which allows for that tag to be called when collision function (you can find more about those in [[Functions]]) is used. Tags also help to sort out objects. Here is a quick example of one in use;

To set a tag requires you to go into the object's inspector & set a pre-made one or make your own.

Layers are a similar thing to Tags, I know that they do something different, but I have yet to figure that out.

If statements just need the if then the thing that activates it inside parentheses, these things are usually [[Functions]] being checked for something.
