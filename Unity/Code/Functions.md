Functions are one of if not the most used thing in unity development, every time you code it is in a [[Collision and Trigger Code]] *Function* or doing things like [[Fixing The Frame Rate]] needs to be in the *Awake* function. [[Getting Components]] requires the use of *at least* the Start function. 
There are ==Pre-made Functions== & ==Self-made Functions==;
==Pre-made Functions== are functions like *Update*, *Awake* or *Start*, they are created by Unity to help you get started. *Update* & *Start* are both preplaced by Unity in every *C#* script you make.
