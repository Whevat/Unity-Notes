Sometimes in games when things are broken or killed you might them deleted so you don't have to think about them anymore, of course they'll come back after the game is reset.

The code is quite simple; Destroy([Object], [time before destroyed])

It also has it's own little function called *OnDestroy*, which makes it so that once the object is destroyed it'll do something. You can find out more about [[Functions]] here.
