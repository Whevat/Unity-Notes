The piece of code [SerializeField] will make a space where the code is in the Game Object to insert another thing/object

In Code:

Depending on what comes after private/public decides whether the slot is a drop-down or a "select slot"

HOWEVER fields that are serialised CANNOT be used in other scripts, you can just see them in the inspector.
