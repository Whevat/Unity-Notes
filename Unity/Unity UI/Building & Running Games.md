This menu will only show up the first time you build a game, every time after the first that you want to change some setting you have to press CTRL + SHIFT + S as seen in [[Scene UI Hotkeys]]. Here in the settings you can choose which scenes you want to build & what platform you want to build it for (PC {Windows, MacOS, Linux}, Xbox, PS4/5, etc). After you've what you want just press ==Build & Run== & it will start the process, this can take a while depending on how much stuff you've got in the game, so prepare to wait a while. It should ask you to make a folder somewhere to put the stuff & then it will open it! It should look something similar to this;
