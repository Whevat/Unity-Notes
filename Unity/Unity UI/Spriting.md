Spriting is a crucial part of 2D game making with Unity. The process of spriting consists of making a multiple drawings that together will form an animation. These drawings are called a sprite sheet.

However, this doesn't mean that you are done, as you need to configure these sprites in Unity. When you import your sprite sheet into Unity you it is recommended that you change some of the settings for the image in the inspector.

Once you've changed the settings to what you'd like, open the sprite editor. This will open another menu where you can slice your sprites, so that you can animate them.

Once this is done it will create child files from the sliced sprites. These can be found by clicking the arrow to the right of the original (parent) file when hovering over it.
